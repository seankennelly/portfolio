# Portfolio Site README

## Description
This website acts as a portfolio to showcase some of the projects I have completed. It also lists my relevant education and has a link to my C.V.

## Features
The site is currently light on features but does have some. They are:
1. A responsive Bootstrap navbar, which collapses on smaller screens
2. CSS animations. These introduce the header picture and the section headings to the page with animations
3. Header photo JavaScript. The header photo reacts to clicks with the only JS on the page. It cycles through an array of CSS animation classes
4. The 'Courses' section is displayed differently depending on screen size. On smaller screens it is a list of Bootstrap cards. On larger screens these cards are put into a carousel to be flicked through. This is more compact and sits alongside the next section, my C.V.
5. A responsive footer which stacks vertically on small screens and horizonally on large screens
