The structure of this website is largely built, but the work is far from over!

1. Saved By The Bush is not yet up
2. Links in footer are not all valid
3. LinkedIn isn't even set up yet!
4. There should be Github repos for most of these projects
5. The hover-revealed project texts should have 2 links each:
	1. The site (active)
	2. The Github repo
6. Relevant Experience - 'Design & Build' needs beefing up
6. The 'Courses' section needs beefing up. Codecademy is lacking and Kreativestorm must be filled in
7. This site needs to be launced on GreekGeeks!
8. Once all these things are done this document should be deleted, and these files should be in a nice clean Github repo
